Smidgen
=======

Smidgen is a syntax for messaging interface definition and
generation. This project aims to provide a language for defining
component input/output messaging interfaces and a set of utilities to
generate code and documentation from these definitions. The structure
of input and output data is defined using `Tydl`_.

`Smidgen`_ is part of the `Code Craftsmen`_ project.  The
`documentation`_ is hosted on `Read the Docs`_ and the `source code`_
can be found on `GitHub`_.
